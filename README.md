## Inspiration

This was definitely inspired by LEGO's
[design, set 50425](https://brickset.com/sets/850425-1/Desk-Business-Card-Holder).

I really like the printed tiles in this set and who doesn't need more minifigs!
But those colors look like they just went with all of the primary colors.
We probably don't need a blank business card to fill in, but they made
it look nice.  Still, I can't imagine why LEGO made the back of this *straight*.
Clearly it should be sloped like every other business card holder made.

I'm sorry I don't include a minifig with my version.  I'm open to suggestions.

## version 2

I moved to [Studio](https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page).
Studio imported the [LDR model](business_card_holder.ldr) just fine.

I've been wanting to swap out the 3895 Technic 1x12 brick because the color
showed on the sides and there's little reason to waste a $.60 part on this
when 3 cheaper parts will do.  Right now the blue 3010 is $.08 and the dark
bluish gray is also $.08, so you're saving $.34.

I then took the [Lime and Yellow version in Studio](business_card_holder2.io)
and made a [Blue and White version](business_card_holder2_blue.io).
The blue and white version now has
[PDF instructions](business_card_holder_v2_instructions.pdf).

## version 1

I did version 1 in [LeoCAD](https://www.leocad.org/) with Lime bricks and
yellow accents.
The [LeoCAD-generated instructions](leocad_v1_instructions/README.md) are
still included in this git repo.
