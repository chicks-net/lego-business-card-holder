# LEGOÂ® business card holder

## Inspiration

This was definitely inspired by LEGO's
[design 850425](https://brickset.com/sets/850425-1/Desk-Business-Card-Holder).

I really like the printed tiles in this set and who doesn't need more minifigs!
But those colors are pretty sad.  We probably don't need a blank business card to fill in,
but they made it look nice.  Still, I can't imagine why LEGO made the back of this *straight*.
Clearly it should be sloped like every other business card holder made.

I'm sorry I don't include a minifig with this.
